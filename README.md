# GA Student Directory

This website is designed to serve as a directory of General Assembly students at NYC. There are always at least 3 active SEI cohorts each week at GA. This app allows SEI students to see all the students taking a SEI course at a given time, which cohort they are in, and share additional background information about themselves.
